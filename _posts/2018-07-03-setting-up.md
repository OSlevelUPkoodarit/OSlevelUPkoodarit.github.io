In the future training we will assume that you have these things installed. That's because examples in the materials will be  implemented using Python and R as programming languages. Following steps will guide you through setting up them into your computer and installing basic libraries needed to get your hands dirty.

Select the relevant section below:
* Python
    * [MacOS X](#macos)
    * [Linux Ubuntu](#linux)
    * [Windows](#windows)
* R
    * [MacOS X](#macos-1)
    * [Linux Ubuntu](#linux-1)
    * [Windows](#windows-1)
* Jupyter
    * [MacOS X](#macos-2)
    * [Linux Ubuntu](#linux-2)
    * [Windows](#windows-2)

## Installing Python
We will use Python version 3 in our examples. They can be implemented with Python 2.7, too, but it is not recommended as there are some differences between the versions.

### MacOS 
First we need to install _Homebrew_. Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS and is very useful when developing stuff on your computer. In this tutorial we only use it for installing Python and pip, though.

Installing Homebrew happens with following command on terminal:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
and then with Homebrew one can install _Python 3_ with
```
brew install python3
```
This command installs _Python 3_ and _pip_, which is package manager for Python. We will install needed Python libraries with it. 

First thing we want to install is _virtualenv_. Virtualenv isolates your installations so that when you have multiple projects, everything will be separated and you can use different versions for different projects. Virtualenv can be installed with command

```
pip install virtualenv
```
