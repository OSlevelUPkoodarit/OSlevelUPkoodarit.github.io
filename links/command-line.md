# Command Line

## [The Linux command line for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
This tutorial will teach you a little of the history of the command line, then walk you through some practical exercises to become familiar with a few basic commands and concepts. We’ll assume no prior knowledge, but by the end we hope you’ll feel a bit more comfortable the next time you’re faced with some instructions that begin “Open a terminal”.
